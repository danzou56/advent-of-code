## Automation Information

This repository contains code that automatically requests a user's input data if
* an `.env` file or appropriate environment is provided containing `AOC_TOKEN`, `AOC_GIT_URL`, and 
  `CONTACT_EMAIL`
* that input file does not already exist on the file system

This repository follows the [automation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation)
on the [/r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) community wiki:
* Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached on the local filesystem and are not requested again
* A `User-Agent` header is always provided; if `AOC_GIT_URL` and `CONTACT_EMAIL` are not provided,
  the HTTP request is never performed
* Automated retrieval of statistics are not a part of this repository
* **Warning**: if multiple input files are missing, this repository has no guardrails to prevent 
  successive requests
